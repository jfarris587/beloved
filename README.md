# Beloved Transportation

This is a android application, with a web-based office portal that a non-profit company uses for their transportation services. The android application, used by drivers, has many features such as detailed client info, Google Maps integration, and text/calling. The web portal allows the home office of the non-profit to schedule their clients for pickups and drop offs.

# Motivation

Beloved Transportation is a Bloomington local non-profit organization that takes on the role of providing medical transportation to the disabled (elderly, physically/mentally disabled). Many of these people have no way of getting to their doctors appointments, which they have many of because of their condition. Beloved Transportation has lent the hand to provide the solution for these people.

Nevertheless, the organization has had a influx of clients, making their current process slow their growth. Being without a proper IT solution, pen and paper was their only method of proper organization. However, with a technology solution, their growth could be increased exponentially.

# Technology

- Java
- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

The mobile application was built for Android using Java as the foundational programming language. The MySQL database was queried with SQL and PHP as the server-side language. For the web based portal, HTML, CSS and JavaScript were for the front end with PHP and MySQL on the back end as well.

# Android Features

**Hashed Authentication:** Being that the non-profit is an actual business and each individual driver needs to access their own set of clients through the app, password authentication was a must. Hashing of passwords is used and key to prevent SQL injection in the code that would be a critical threat to the private information stored in the database. 

**Google Maps API:** One of the biggest features of the Android app is its use of Google Maps for the drivers to know what routes they are going to take to pick up their next client. Google Maps API is key in accomplishing this goal.

**Client Information:** The next key feature is viewing the client information for those they are picking up. Since they are disabled, some may not be physically able to walk to the car themselves and need assistance. Having that information through the app lets drivers know ahead of time if they will need aid them, or if they can wait in the car.

**Text/Call:** Part of a drivers day includes calling the home office. Being busy driving, and trying to make a call is not only hard, but dangerous. With one-touch features, the driver can instantly call the office, or send a text to the office to notify them that they are on the road but need to contact them about an issue (the office can then call whenever they receive the message)

**SMS Alerts:** Likewise, when picking up clients, drivers don't like waiting for the clients to get ready. With one-touch alerts, the driver can send an SMS alert to the client to notify them that they have almost arrived to pick them up.

**Calendar View:** Driver's like knowing what their schedule is when available. Now with the app they can view their daily schedule in the morning to plan their day around their pickups. In addition, the drivers can view their calendar schedule for days in advance to plan days off, or events around their hourly work.

# Web Features

**Driver Enrollment:** Since the drivers are registered employees, they require drug tests, licenses to be up to date, driving tests, etc. Being able to keep track of this information is vital to the organization. Getting emailed reminders if a driver needs to renew a test helps them stay ahead of the curve.

**Client Additions:** Keeping track of the client information and adding everything to the database becomes much easier with the web interface. All of this same information is later given to the driver via the app.

**Scheduling:** The last part of the web interface is being able to easy schedule clients for transportation with their drivers. This ties everything together, and gets rid of pen and paper schedules and makes the Android app come to life.
